Hello Lokinet. Glad you've made it!

You are viewing the setup page of SNApp-PI-HOST available free here: <a href="https://github.com/necro-nemesis/SNApp-Pi-Host">Github</a>

Your webpages can replace the current index.html file in the /home/$USER/snapp dirctory.
Simply stop the server with openning the detached screen with "screen -r snapp" then "Ctrl C".
You can then add your webpage files to this directory.
To restart the SNapp server navigate to that folder and enter "sudo ./snapp.sh" and the
server will restart in a detached screen called "snapp".

If you find this helpful please donate.
